      # Thank you for opening a new issue!
    
      We welcome suggestions for changes to Quire or new features. Before submitting your idea, please consider the following questions.
       
      - Is this change/feature useful to a majority of Quire users?
      - Does this change/feature support Quire‚Äôs core principles in creating publications that are discoverable, enduring, beautiful, and accessible?
      - Does this change/feature require significant added dependencies or have any potential long-term maintenance requirements?

      As a general rule of thumb, any feature that would only be of interest to a small subgroup of users should be implemented as a third-party add-on to Quire, or perhaps initially just to your project alone.
